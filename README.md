# Welcome to the KissAnime project

## About our Project:
This web application is intended to help Anime(Japanese animation) lovers to:
- Discover new anime releases
- View animie information
- Manage Anime collections: keep track of animes that you are watching, watched, or plan to watch

## Heroku Link:
[KissAnime](https://kissanime-frontend.herokuapp.com/)

## About our API:

Our project would use [Kitsu](https://hummingbird-me.github.io/api-docs/#tag/Anime) as the external API.
Kitsu is a modern anime discovery platform that helps people track the anime you're watching, discover new anime and socialize with other fans. Kitsu has its own database. 

## Search criteria

The user can enter any characters in the search box. The [Kitsu](https://hummingbird-me.github.io/api-docs/#tag/Anime) API would use users' input to query the database and return the result. If there are some matches in the database, our project would show the results. If not, nothing would be shown.

The API uses fuzzy searching to find relevant animes, which means the API would find all animes that are likely to be relevant to the search keyword.

## Summary results

The result would show a couple of things:
- The title of the anime.
- The poster image of the anime.
- The average rating of this anime.
- The description (and source) of this anime.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
